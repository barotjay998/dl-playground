    "- BatchNormalization in addition to improving training speed, acts as a **regularizer**, reducing generalization error. Batch normalization accomplishes this by scaling the output of a layer by subtracting the batch mean and dividing by the batch standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- L2 regularization: L2 regularization is a regularization technique that penalizes the squared magnitude of all parameters directly in the objective. L2 regularization is also known as weight decay as it forces the weights to decay towards zero (but not exactly zero). The optimization procedure is modified so that at each step, each weight value is first decayed towards zero by a factor proportional to the learning rate. Only after this step is complete, the usual gradient descent step based on the current mini-batch is taken. \n",
    "    - We can add L2 regularization to a layer by passing kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(l2) to the layer constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique for reducing overfitting in neural networks by preventing complex co-adaptations on training data. It is a very efficient way of performing model averaging with neural networks. The term \"dropout\" refers to dropping out units (both hidden and visible) in a neural network.\n",
    "    - We can add dropout to a layer by passing a Dropout layer to the model, specifying the dropout rate, which is the fraction of the features that are being zeroed-out; it is usually between 0.2 and 0.5. At test time, no units are dropped out, instead the layer's output values are scaled down by a factor equal to the dropout rate, to balance for the fact that more units are active than at training time."
